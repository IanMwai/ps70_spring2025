<h4 class="title">Kinetic Sculpture</h4>
<p>
  For my Kinetic sculpture I got inspiration from this youtube video (See below). 
  This design seems to be very popular. Most of the sculptures I saw that had two
  wheels revolving in opposite directions used this design.
</p>

<p>
  I did not want to cut the design by hand, it would have taken a long time.
  So I used the video tutorial below, to replicate the design in Fusion. 
</p>

<div class="video-container left-align">
  <iframe 
      src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YBxEiNGmfz0" 
      frameborder="0" 
      allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
      allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

This is how it looks like in my Fusion:

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
  <img src="fusion model.png" alt="Centered Image of a fusion model" style="width: 600px; height: auto;">
</div>
<br>
<p>
  I printed this design and cut two copies it on the laser cutter. 
  Then I attached each to pulley wheels I found in the lab using hot glue.
  I then attached an axle through both wheels and cut tiny wood pieces to 
  prevent the wheel from falling off the axle or colliding with each other.

  <br>

  The next bit was fixing this on a stand and I had to fix the DC motor on a similar 
  stand. Then I connected smaller pulley wheels on both sides of the motor
  and cut some string to use as a belt. 
  
  <br> 
  
  This is where most of the problems came in. The string was either too loose
  or did not rotate at all. This was made worse by the fact that both the motor 
  and the wheels were not stable enough so I could not exert a lot of tension on them.
</p>

<p>
  But the two images below show the final outcome!
</p>

</div>

<br>

The system is complemented by this simple circuit.

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">

<p>
  The circuit has a switch that can either turn the current on or off.
  The LED let's you know whem the current is on, as it lights up green. There is also
  a potentiometer (a variable resistor) that limits current through the LED and the motor
  but also serves as a knob to control the speed of the motor. It does this by increasing or 
  reducing voltage drop across it when the knob is turned. The capacitor was added here to smooth 
  current flow as it stores some charge when circuit is turned on and keeps releasing
  this voltage when the switch is turned off (It stores some voltage). That is why the LED keep 
  glowing for a few seconds after the switch is turned off. 
  
  <br>
  <br>

  It seems the motor needs a lot of voltage though because I could not 
  turn the knob much before it stopped rotating.
</p>

<p>
  The first video below shows the circuit in action without the motor and the 
  second video shows it with the motor connected.

  The following video shows the whole system in action. The pulley system needs
  some tweaking though. And I should probably have cut out the designs in plywood instead
  of cardboard.

  (Victor helped me take the video, and also debug some stuff in Fusion, Thanks!)
