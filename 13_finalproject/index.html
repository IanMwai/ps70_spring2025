<h3 class="title">Final Project: Smart Cycling Companion!</h3>

<br>

<h4 class="title">Project Introduction</h4>
<p>

  The Smart Cycling Companion is a custom-built, technology-enhanced system designed to improve safety, convenience, 
  and usability for cyclists. The system integrates turn signals, speed monitoring, and automatic lighting adjustments, 
  all controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller. <br>
  I chose this project one, because of a personal passion for cycling and two because it will give me the opportunity
  to apply to a practical real-world problem my Electrical Engineering skills, while gaining design skills.
</p>

<h4 class="title">How It Works</h4>
<p>
  1. Turn Signals with Auto-Off Feature: Handlebar-mounted buttons allow the cyclist to signal turns. A motion and tilt 
  sensor (MPU6050) detects when a turn is completed and automatically turns off the signal. <br>

  2. Speed Monitoring & Display: A Hall effect sensor measures wheel rotation to calculate speed. The speed is displayed 
  on a water-resistant LED screen mounted on the handlebars. <br>

  3. Automatic Light Adjustment: A light sensor (LDR) detects ambient lighting conditions. LED brightness automatically 
  adjusts for better visibility in low-light conditions. <br>

  4. Power & Durability: Powered by a 5V USB power bank, ensuring easy recharging. The system is housed in a 3D-printed 
  waterproof enclosure, designed to withstand outdoor cycling conditions.
</p>


<h4 class="title">Why This Project Matters</h4>
<p>
  - Enhanced Safety: Clear turn signals improve visibility for other road users. <br>
  - Hands-Free Automation: Auto turn-off signals reduce the need for manual operation. <br>
  - Real-Time Feedback: Speed tracking allows cyclists to monitor their performance. <br>
  - It's fun way to gain engineering and design skills!
</p>

<h4 class="title">3D Model</h4>
<p>
  I am yet to create a 3D model as I couldn't figure out
  which software was best for illustration. I am used to LTspice but 
  it does not have most sensors, actuators or the ESP32 microntroller.
  I may try to do this in fusion but this is a new software for me and  
  the designing will take a while. Below see atteched a very rough sketch with components. I 
  will update this page with the 3D model once I have it.

<h4 class="title">Project Timeline</h4>

<p>
  This is a rough timeline of what I plan to do for the project. I will update this page as I progress. My class
  assignments going forward may revolve around this project and its obejctives.
</p>
<P>
  This Week: I will begin by 3D modeling and printing the enclosure that will house the
   ESP32 microcontroller and the power source.
</P>
<P>Week 6: Test the sensors I am planning to use to get familiar. Particularly
  Hall effect and LDR sensors. <br>
</P>
<p>
  Week 7: Test the actuators and the buttons. I will try to take input 
  from the microcontroller and display it on the screen and also use input
  from sensos in week 6 to make Leds on or off <br>
</p>

<p>
  Spring Break: Complete the full 3D model for my project <br>
</p>

<p>
  Week 8: Start working on the PCB design and the code for the project. <br>
</p>

<p>
  Week 9 onwards: Put it all together and start testing. I may also
  develop custom parts to attach to bike <br>
