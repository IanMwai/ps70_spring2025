### PHYSCI 70 (PS 70)
PS 70 is a class offered at Harvard where students learn digital fabrication by doing. Here instead of a traditional classroom, you study in a machineshop instead. I had the priviledge of taking this class Spring of 2025. 

The most unique thing about PS 70 is assignments are submitted in webpages instead of the typical Canvas/Gradescope submission.
Therefore, at the end of the semester, each one of us had a webpage, like mine, where they had documented all the work they had done over the weeks. 
Think, a portfolio website, but specifically for digital fabrication.

You can go to my static website here: https://ianmwai.github.io/ps70_spring2025/ to see my weekly assignments and Final Project. If you want to learn more about PS70, check out they class page here: https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/ps70/people.html .

And if you are a Harvard student or Summer school participant considering taking it, definitely do!
