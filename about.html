    Hello, my name is Ian Toyota, a sophomore in Currier House studying Electrical Engineering. I was born and raised in Kenya, East Africa.
    In my free time I cook (mostly stews and food from home), cycle, play soccer (I play right back or center back) and watch YouTube videos about Engineering and design. On campus,
    I am involved in model UN and I am planning to join Engineers Without Boarders and Harvard Undergraduate Automotive Society this semester. <br><br> I am in this class to figure out whether I like building stuff and to improve my software and design skills.
    I figured I need design skills (from conception to implementation) if I plan to build cool stuff in the future, and I think this
    class offers such skills. I am good at analog circuit design  (or at least I think I am) and I am so looking forward to programming microcontrollers
    in week 4! Otherwise, very excited to learn all the other skills from course staff and peers in the class. <br><br> Last on my to do list for this class is to meet new people, make friends and have fun so please say hi when you see me around :D

This is a random video I watched this weekend of a guy designing a mechanical calculator. My FYP is mostly made up of these. <br></br>
