<h3 class = "title">Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are two ideas I have for the final project. I am still brainstorming and I am open to suggestions and feedback.
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4 class = "title" >Idea 1 : Bike indicator lights and Speedometer.</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>
For this project, I want to add brake lights, turn signals,
and a speedometer to my bike for better safety and visibility. 
The brake light will turn on automatically when I slow down, using an accelerometer to detect deceleration. 
Handlebar-mounted turn signals will help signal turns more clearly, and a speedometer will track speed and distance, 
displaying it on a small screen. The system will be powered by a rechargeable battery and controlled by a microcontroller. <br></br>
one of the biggest challenges is where to place the sensors—the accelerometer 
needs to be in a stable position to detect braking accurately, and the turn signal controls 
should be easy to access while riding. Balancing power consumption and making sure the 
system is weatherproof are also key challenges.

<h4 class = "title">Idea 2: Smart desk organizer</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

For this one, I want to build a smart desk organizer that helps keep 
track of small items like keys, stationery, stylus, and phone. 
It will use RFID or sensors to detect whether an item is in its designated spot
and display notifications when something is missing. The organizer will also include wireless charging
for my phone and LED indicators for alerts or reminders.<br></br> Biggest nticipated challenge is accurately 
detecting items—RFID works well
for tagged objects, but small metallic items like pens may need a different approach. 
Another challenge is designing the compartments so they are both functional and easy to 
access while keeping the organizer compact and neat.
