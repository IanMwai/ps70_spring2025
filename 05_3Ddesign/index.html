<h3>Week 5: 3D Design & Printing</h3>

<h3 class="title">3D Design</h3>
<p>
  Will update 3D model and printing later today.

<h3 class="title">Photogrammetry</h3>

<p>
  I used the iphone app polycam to scan my bike helmet (see video below).
  The app uses photos to create the 3D mesh (photgrammetry) and has a very friendly user interface.
  But this comes at the cost of
  functionality. It is very limited in what you can do with the
  actual model after processing is complete. "Ckeaning up" the model is 
  almost impossible. Only the crop functionality proved helpful but drawing polygons
  to cutout unwanted background could have been easier and more accurate than explicit planes.<br><br>
  I did the scanning at night and had to do it multiple times
  because the lightinng was hard to work with. It was very easy ti cas a shadow on the object. 
  Also figured in the process that polycam only allows you to go back two steps after
  editing. For example, if you crop the object multiple times and crop too much, you can only go back two steps
  and have to start over.<br><br>
  The app also has a very limited export functionality unless you pay for the pro version.
   You can only export the model as an GLTF file, photos or video. I chose video.

<h3 class="title">Final Project Update</h3>

<p>
  As part of this week's assignment, I updated my <a style="color: crimson;" href="../13_finalproject">Final Project</a> page with a 
  design idea, Bill of Materials (BOM) and a rough timeline.
